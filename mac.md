## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is Development ops tool and is used for source code management.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a tool used to manage multiple versions of source code edits and changes and git hub is a cloud location used to store these changes and adaptations.
3. Why do we create a branch? Branches allow one to develop features, fix bugs, or safely ecperiment with new ideas in a contained area of one's repository. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to show a high level over-view of the changes between your branch and the base branch. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.  That would be git switch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch is where you bring the code in, git merge is where you merge the old and the new fixing the code, The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Under your repository name, click Pull requests.
In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.
Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts.
